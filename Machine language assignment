Healthcare - Predicting Patient Readmission

*Problem Statement:*

Reducing hospital readmissions is a critical concern in healthcare, as it leads to increased costs, morbidity, and mortality. Accurately identifying patients at risk of readmission can help healthcare providers take proactive measures to prevent it.

*Solutions:*

Machine learning can help predict patient readmission by analyzing electronic health records (EHRs), claims data, and other relevant information. By identifying high-risk patients, healthcare providers can:

1. Intensify patient engagement and education
2. Optimize treatment plans and medication management
3. Coordinate post-discharge care and follow-up appointments

*ML Algorithms:*

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Neural Networks

*Data Set:*

The dataset used for this problem can be a combination of:

1. Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
2. Claims data
3. Patient demographics
4. Clinical data (e.g., lab results, medication lists)
5. Historical readmission data

Some publicly available datasets that can be used for this problem include:

1. MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III)
2. eICU-CRD (eICU Collaborative Research Database)
3. CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) claims data
